## What is Kampff?

**Kampff** is an agent skill. Feed it text traces — posts, comments, replies — get back a **human dossier**:

- **Worldview fit** — politics, ideology, religion, philosophy (from language patterns, not stereotypes)
- **Alliance fit** — can you work or go together?
- **Ephemeris** — how someone **changed over time** (drift, turning points)
- **Distance** — `engage` · `neutral` · `caution` · `avoid` (with quoted evidence)
- **You too** — the viewer is in the pool. Comparison, not judgment from nowhere.

**No scraping built in.** Your collector gathers text. Kampff analyzes.

Analysis engine: **spectrograph** — 7 layers, optional HR and OSINT lenses.

```
graphify     → code → graph
